**2.1** Let $S$ be a finite set with $n$ elements. Since $S$ is finite, we can list out its elements $s_1, s_2, ... , s_n$. We can specify a function $f : S \rightarrow S$ by specifying one element of $S$ for each element of $S$.

First we choose $f(s_1)$. There are $n$ possible choices, these being any of $s_1$ through $s_n$. Then, in choosing the next element, there are $n-1$ choices, these being all the elements of $S$ except the one chosen for $f(s_1)$. We may not choose the same element as $f(s_1)$, since then the function would no longer be injective. Similarly, we have $n-2$ choices for $f(s_3)$, $n-3$ choices for $f(s_4)$ and so on. Finally, at $f(s_n)$ there is only 1 choice. Ultimately, there are $n!$ injections from $S \rightarrow S$. These are also surjective, since we pick every element of $S$ to output to. So there are $n!$ bijections from $S \rightarrow S$.

**2.2**

($\Rightarrow$) Let $f : A \rightarrow B$ have a right inverse, with $A \neq \emptyset$. Want to show that $f$ is surjective.
