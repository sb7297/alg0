**3.1**
Let $A, B, C$ be objects in $\mathsf{C}$ and hence objects in $\mathsf{C}^{op}$. Let $f \in \Hom_{\Cop}(A, B)$ and $g \in \Hom_{\Cop}(B,C)$. Thus $f \in \Hom_{\Cat}(B,A)$ and $g \in \Hom_{\Cat}(C, B)$. Since $\Cat$ is a category, the morphism $f \circ_{\Cat} g$ exists in $\Cat$. Define $\circ_{\Cop}$ as $g \circ_{\Cop} f := f \circ_{\Cat} g$. We are guaranteed that the composition of morphisms exists since $\Cat$ is a category. We gain associativity for the same reason. The composition of identity in $\Cop$ becomes composition of identity on the other side in $\Cat$, which is still an identity.

**3.2** $\mathsf{End}_{\mathsf{Set}}(A)$ is defined as $\Hom_{\CSet}(A, A)$. This is the set of all set-functions $A \to A$; in other words, the set $A^A$. Thus $|\mathsf{End}_{\CSet}(A)| = |A^A| = |A|^{|A|}$ (the last equality from a previous exercise.)
