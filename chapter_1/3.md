**3.1**
Let $A, B, C$ be objects in $\mathsf{C}$ and hence objects in $\mathsf{C}^{op}$. Let $f \in \Hom_{\Cop}(A, B)$ and $g \in \Hom_{\Cop}(B,C)$. Thus $f \in \Hom_{\Cat}(B,A)$ and $g \in \Hom_{\Cat}(C, B)$. Since $\Cat$ is a category, the morphism $f \circ_{\Cat} g$ exists in $\Cat$. Define $\circ_{\Cop}$ as $g \circ_{\Cop} f := f \circ_{\Cat} g$. We are guaranteed that the composition of morphisms exists since $\Cat$ is a category. We gain associativity for the same reason. The composition of identity in $\Cop$ becomes composition of identity on the other side in $\Cat$, which is still an identity.
