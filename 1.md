**1.2** Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on the set $S$. Now let $P_S$ be a family such that the members of $P_S$ are sets of the form $[a] = \{ b : b \in S, b \sim a \}$ where the $a$ are members of $S$. We wish to show that $P_S$ is a partition of $S$. We must show that the sets which are elements of $P_S$ are nonempty, that they are disjoint, and that their union is $S$.

*Nonempty.* Each set $[a]$ contains $a$, since $a \sim a$ by the reflexive property of equivalence relations.

*Disjoint.* Let $a \in A, a \in A'$, where $A, A' \in P_S$. Let $b \in A$. $A$ is some $[c]$, and therefore $b \sim c$. But also $a \sim c$, since $a \in A$. And $c \sim a$, and thus $b \sim a$. Now $A'$ is some $[d]$, and $a \sim d$. But $b \sim a \sim d$, so $b \sim d$. Thus $b \in A'$. By the same logic, an arbitrary member of $A'$ is in $A$. So $A' = A$. Thus the members of $P_S$ are disjoint.

*Union is $S$.* Consider the union $S' = \bigcup_{k \in S} [k]$. Let $a \in S$. Then clearly $a \in S'$, since $[a]$ is one of the components of the union. Let $a \in S'$. Then $a \sim k$ for some $k$ in $S$, so $a$ must be in $S$.

**1.3** Let $P_S$ be a partition of $S$. Now consider the relation $\sim$ given by $a \sim b$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are in the same set in the partition $P_S$. This is an equivalence relation.

*Reflexive.* Clearly, $a$ is in the same set as $a$ in $P_S$. So $a \sim a$.

*Symmetric.* If $a$ and $b$ are in the same set, then $b$ and $a$ are in the same set.

*Transitive.* If $a \in Q$ and $b \in Q$, and $b \in Q$ and $c \in Q$, then $a \in Q$ and $c \in Q$. So $a \sim b \wedge b \sim c \Rightarrow a \sim c$.

**1.6**

*Reflexive.* $a-a=0 \in \mathbb{Z}$.

*Symmetric.* Let $a \sim b$. Then $b-a \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $-(b-a) = a-b \in \mathbb{Z}$. So $b \sim a$.

*Transitive.* Let $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$. Thus $(b-a) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $(c-b) \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $(c-b)+(b-a) = (c-a) \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $a \sim c$.
