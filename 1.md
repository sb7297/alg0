**1.2** Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on the set $S$. Now let $P_S$ be a family such that the members of $P_S$ are sets of the form $[a] = \{ b : b \in S, b \sim a \}$ where the $a$ are members of $S$. We wish to show that $P_S$ is a partition of $S$. We must show that the sets which are elements of $P_S$ are nonempty, that they are disjoint, and that their union is $S$.

**Nonempty.** Each set $[a]$ contains $a$, since $a \sim a$ by the reflexive property of equivalence relations.

**Disjoint.** Let $a \in A, a \in A'$, where $A, A' \in P_S$. Let $b \in A$. $A$ is some $[c]$, and therefore $b \sim c$. But also $a \sim c$, since $a \in A$. And $c \sim a$, and thus $b \sim a$. Now $A'$ is some $[d]$, and $a \sim d$. But $b \sim a \sim d$, so $b \sim d$. Thus $b \in A'$. By the same logic, an arbitrary member of $A'$ is in $A$. So $A' = A$. Thus the members of $P_S$ are disjoint.

**Union is S.** Consider the union $S' = \bigcup_{k\in S} [k]$. Let $a \in S$. Then clearly $a \in S'$, since $[a]$ is one of the components of the union. Let $a \in S'$. Then $a \sim k$ for some $k$ in $S$, so $a$ must be in $S$.
